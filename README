What is this app?
----------------------------------------

This application was developed because I needed a quick way to take a folder structure
and turn it into a podcast feed. The structure was there, I just wanted to use it.
So I wrote this, and with the use of the mighty Dropbox, hosted everything, all synced.

If you need to generate a podcast and have all the files just ready (on your server or otherwise)
then this is a handy little app to generate the xml for you.



Quick start
----------------------------------------
Once built, just alter the lib/standard-podcast-context.xml, and execute run(.sh|bat)
It should take care of the rest.
The folder structure should be

mainFolder
	-category1
		-file
		-file
		-file
	-category2
		-...

Placing a info.txt file in either the category folder or the mainFolder allows you to override the defaults
and provide more info, like Author,Custom Descriptions and Description Templates
A full list of all options will appear here soon!

Building
----------------------------------------
Ensure all libaries are there in the lib folder and run the build script:

ant -f build.xml

A list of all libraries used should be in the lib folder.


Testing
----------------------------------------
In the midst of writing a test script... be patient. 
Basically the best thing to create the folder structure, and point the generator at it.
And then have a look at the xml!

Running
----------------------------------------
Use run.(sh|bat) to run it, or alternatively, add the respective libraries to your classpath and run the jar

java -cp $CP -jar podcastGenerator.jar

Other Info
----------------------------------------

Be aware that its not cool to have spaces in the name, so make sure each sub-directory and each file below
that does not have a space in its name!
This is particularly prevalent on Mac OS X as in iTunes it will not recognise a URL with a space in it (as per
the spec), but it Windows it will be fine.
